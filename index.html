        <p class="infoparagraph">My name is Jenny Boerner. I obtainted my bachelor's degree in Accounting from University of Wisconsin nearly ten years ago. Since then, I have establisted a career in Supply Chain. My current role is a Project Procurement Manager for a company that focuses on sustainable energy upgrades. All of our upgrades are performed on federal buildings such as, air force bases and navy bases. We resently finished a project at NASA, and we are starting a project at the Pentagon very soon. My work involves negotiating and executing the subcontracts for the contractors to perform construction for the upgrades. I work directly with the Development Engineers, Project Managers and Operations Managers to ensure a succesfull project.</p>
        
        <p class="infoparagraph">Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to develop supply chain software solutions using SharePoint to create efficiencies within our department. With the exposure I experienced during these activities, I discovered my interest in programming. After building two seperate programs for my last two employers, I decided a career change would be something worth pursueing. I am excited to be taking this course and to learm more about this field.</p>
